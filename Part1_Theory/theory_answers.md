1. Short Answer Questions
Q1: TensorFlow vs. PyTorch

TensorFlow: More production-oriented, used with TensorFlow Serving, mobile (TF Lite), etc.

PyTorch: Research-friendly, dynamic computation graph, intuitive debugging.

Use case choice:

Use TensorFlow when deploying models to production at scale.

Use PyTorch when prototyping, experimenting, or doing academic work.

Q2: Use cases for Jupyter Notebooks

Prototyping and experimenting with machine learning models.

Teaching/explaining concepts via visual, step-by-step documentation.

Q3: spaCy vs. basic string operations

spaCy provides linguistic features (POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER) and pre-trained pipelines.

Basic string ops are manual and lack semantic/contextual understanding.

2. Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs. TensorFlow
Feature	Scikit-learn	TensorFlow
Target Applications	Classical ML (SVMs, trees, etc.)	Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, etc.)
Ease of Use	Beginner-friendly API	Steeper learning curve
Community Support	Strong (especially for ML)	Very strong (enterprise + research)
