📚 Part 1: Theoretical Understanding
✔️ Comparison of TensorFlow vs PyTorch

✔️ Use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI

✔️ spaCy vs Python string operations for NLP

✔️ Comparative analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

📄 See Part1_Theory/theory_answers.md

🔬 Part 2: Practical Implementation
✅ Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn
Dataset: Iris Species

Model: Decision Tree Classifier

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

📎 Output: Confusion matrix

📄 See notebook: Part2_Practical/Task1_ScikitLearn/iris_decision_tree.ipynb

✅ Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow
Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Target Accuracy: >95%

📎 Output: Prediction visualizations on 5 test samples

📄 See notebook: Part2_Practical/Task2_TensorFlow/mnist_cnn_tensorflow.ipynb

✅ Task 3: NLP with spaCy
Dataset: Amazon Product Reviews (sample)

Tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Sentiment Analysis

Tools: spaCy + TextBlob (rule-based)

📄 See notebook: Part2_Practical/Task3_spaCy/amazon_reviews_ner_sentiment.ipynb
